The Fighting Maiden

NOTE: if you are in windows then you might be able to run the program if you create a
new project from VS with the link from your bitbucket and have the SFML folder I included in your c: drive,
it may RUN.

Dodge the hazards, and defeat the enemy!
Receive assistance from NPCs as you try to reach the ultimate goal: the blue warp!

How to play:
- move up: w
- move down: s
- move left: a
- move right: d
- attack: k
- run: hold m
- pause: p
- unpause: u
- quit: y

- Note: there is a brief period after you attack where you cannot attack again. Time your attacks carefully!

How to run the game:
- run main.cpp
- Note: all the test cases must be commented out. They are commented out all by default on submission of the project.

We could not create a makefile because we could not properly link SFML.

To run the test cases, run them individually.
To run a single test case, comment out all other main functions (from both main.cpp and the other test cases).

Considering that we could not get the makefile to work, this approach is the only way to run the game and the test cases.
We did not anticipate that creating a makefile with SFML would be so problematic.
We have spoken with Professor Katchabaw about this problem. He said that we do not have to make a makefile since
they are very troubling with SFML.

Nonetheless, we will have a chance to show off our game in action when we demo it with our TA during
the acceptance test meeting.
