The Fighting Maiden

Authors: Xavier Hill Roy, Bryce Chevallier, Matthew Korkola, Samuel Near, Yakup Tezcan, 

Dodge the hazards, and defeat the enemy!
Receive assistance from NPCs as you try to reach the ultimate goal: the blue warp!

How to play:
- move up: w
- move down: s
- move left: a
- move right: d
- attack: k
- run: hold m
- pause: p
- unpause: u
- quit: y

- Note: there is a brief period after you attack where you cannot attack again. Time your attacks carefully!

How to run the game:
- run main.cpp
- Note: all the test cases must be commented out. They are commented out all by default on submission of the project.

We could not create a makefile because we could not properly link SFML.

To run the test cases, run them individually.
To run a single test case, comment out all other main functions (from both main.cpp and the other test cases).
